To setup Gitea, perform the following:

* Create a user and database for gitea (while granting rights)
* Start gitea.service
* Change the configuration under [server] in /etc/gitea/conf/app.ini and then
  call http://server:port/ (default is http://localhost:3000) to finish setup.

  Alternatively, you can call http://server:port/ and setup from there and
  change /etc/gitea/conf/app.ini afterwards.

You can create an admin user on the console by running:

su - git
gitea --name admin --password somePassword --email some@email.com --admin

---

If you want to access gitea through httpd (apache), install the gitea-httpd
subpackage, and change /etc/httpd/conf.d/gitea.conf. There are comments in that
file that give you examples of how to set it up, either as a vhost or as a
subdirectory like /git

This will require you to also change the [server] section, in particular,
ROOT_URL to match what you are expecting.

I would highly recommend that you setup the webserver to run on a socket rather
than a simple web server. That way, when you setup httpd or nginx, you can run
the reverse proxy into the socket. For example.

<Location />
  ProxyPass unix:/run/gitea/gitea.socket|http://127.0.0.1/
  ProxyPassReverse unix:/run/gitea/gitea.socket|http://127.0.0.1/
</Location>

If you plan on using SSH on the native 22 port, you do *not* have to disable
your default sshd service. Instead, you can add the following line to
/etc/ssh/sshd_config or /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/99-gitea.conf (EL9 and Fedora):

AcceptEnv GIT_PROTOCOL
